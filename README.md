# Land Flipper Game

A multiplayer game with [Colyseus]{https://www.colyseus.io/} for websockets multiplayer messaging. The game logic is carried out server-side.

![demo](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/Land-Flipper-Game/blob/master/screenshots/land-flipper-game.gif)

This scene shows you:

- How to support [Colyseus]{https://www.colyseus.io/} in a Decentraland scene
- How to set up a simple game logic in Colyseus
- How to handle game state changes from the server in your scene
- How to fetch a player's realm
- How to keep track of the state of each realm as a separate room in your game
- How to handle team formation, scoring and time limits from the server


The server takes care of organizing players into teams and only starting a match when there are players on both sides.

Each scene runs its own calculations of the current remaining time and the scores of each team, but so does the server. In the end, the server has the final word about when the match is over and what is the final result.

## Try it out

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command:

```
$ npm i -g decentraland
```

**Run the server locally**

```
$ cd server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```
NOTE: If this is your first time running the scene then you need to run `npm install` before `npm start`

**Run the scene**

Keep the server running, run the scene on a separate command line window:

```
$ cd scene
$ dcl start
```

**Scene Usage**


Open two separate browser windows, and direct one player to the Blue tile and another to the Red tile, so that there are players in both teams.



## Using Colyseus SDK with Decentraland

Install `colyseus.js`:

```
npm install --save colyseus.js
```

Add `colyseus.js` to your `"bundleDependencies"` in your `package.json`:

```json
  "bundleDependencies": [
    "colyseus.js"
  ]
```

To avoid TypeScript compilation errors you'll need to edit `tsconfig.json`, and include a few `///<reference` to your source-code, as you can see in the [scene/src/connection.ts](scene/src/connection.ts) file.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "noLib": false,
    // ...
  }
}
```

```typescript
///<reference lib="es2015.symbol" />
///<reference lib="es2015.symbol.wellknown" />
///<reference lib="es2015.collection" />
///<reference lib="es2015.iterable" />

import { Client } from "colyseus.js";
```

> The Colyseus SDK requires a few TypeScript libraries that are excluded by default by Decentraland.
